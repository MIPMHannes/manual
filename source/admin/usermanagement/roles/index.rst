Manage Roles

.. _PageNavigation roles_index:

As previously mentioned, groups are resources and roles are permissions to those resources. Assigning a user to a role, and assigning the roles to a group, provides more efficient user management. If at any time your permissions concept should change, all that is necessary to do is to reassign the permissions to the roles, or create new roles for a user.

After you've created your first groups, create a list of roles for your organization. Now we will assign these to the roles accordingly.
