System Configuration
####################

Configuring a Znuny is done via :ref:`pagenavigation annexes_entity_management_index`, plus all the add-on and framework settings found here. Whereas the aforementioned :ref:`pagenavigation annexes_entity_management_index`, allows administrators to make settings for the basic usage like queues, states, email addresses, etc. The system configuration allows the administrator to fine tune settings which are system-wide. These include, but are not limited to:

- Visible fields in screens
- Module permissions and availability
- Outgoing email
- Paths, variables and binaries
- State type defaults
- Support Languages
- Working Calendars
- Customer User Self-Registration
- Storage Backends
- Indexes
- Logging
- Add-on settings
- Many more

Generally, we reference settings as we go along in the administrator manual. Therefore, we will not cover all the settings here. More so, you should understand the system configuration tool, how to navigate and search, backup and deploy.

.. _PageNavigation admin_systemconfiguration_search:

System Configuration Search
****************************

The first thing you will see, when you access the menu (and that which is focused with the cursor by default), is the search area. You can search for:

- Setting Names
- Setting Descriptions
- Setting Values

.. figure:: images/admin_system_config_search.png
    :alt: System Config Search

    Search options

When searching for a setting name, there is an assumed prefix and suffix of '*' and the search is case-insensitive. Wildcards in the search term like *N\*te* do not work. Searching for *Note* for example, will return any setting beginning with *Note*, having *Note* in the setting name, or ending with *Note*. Only the settings found with the search term in the name will be displayed as a result. Selecting a setting, will direct you to the single setting view, and just hitting enter will perform a search returning all settings matching any of the above listed values.

.. _PageNavigation admin_systemconfiguration_edit:

System Configuration Edit
*************************

When editing an individual entry, you can quickly edit by hovering over the setting and:

To access this mode, you must select a configuration item from the list when :ref:`searching <pagenavigation admin_systemconfiguration_search>` or use a link copied from the :ref:`menu <pagenavigation admin_systemconfiguration_menu_options>`. In this mode, you can only return to the overview in the actions' sidebar.

.. _PageNavigation admin_systemconfiguration_multiple_settings_mode:

Multiple Settings Mode
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This mode is entered, by hitting enter when :ref:`searching <pagenavigation admin_systemconfiguration_search>` or jumping to a configuration group from the :ref:`menu <pagenavigation admin_systemconfiguration_menu_options>` of any single setting. In this mode, you will not be able to use the navigation from the :ref:`pagenavigation admin_systemconfiguration_sidebar`.

.. _PageNavigation admin_systemconfiguration_group_settings_mode:

.. _PageNavigation admin_systemconfiguration_sidebar:

System Configuration Sidebar
*****************************

In the sidebar, as with most configuration modules (see :ref:`pagenavigation annexes_entity_management_index`), there is a sidebar. In the sidebar, you can 

- Take actions
- Navigate settings

.. figure:: images/admin_system_configuration_side_bar.png
    :alt: System Configuration Sidebar

    System Configuration Sidebar

The actions' menu offers you the opportunity to do the following.

- Deploy settings
- Show settings currently locked for editing
- View favorite settings
- Import or export settings

Sidebar Actions
================

.. _PageNavigation admin_systemconfigruation_deploy:

Deploying Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When editing a setting (see :ref:`pagenavigation admin_systemconfiguration_edit`), it is deployed to the database. The database settings must then be deployed to ``Kernel/Config/Files/ZZZAAuto.pm`` to be applied.

.. figure:: images/admin_system_configuration_review.png
    :alt: Review Screen

    Review Screen

Deploy settings from the review screen.

1. Select which settings should not be deployed (if needed)
2. Deploy

.. figure:: images/admin_sytem_configuration_deploy.png
    :alt: System Configuration Deployment
    
    System Configuration Deployment

Each deployment is protocol led in the database, and when confirming deployment, a comment can be entered to protocol the reason for the deployment.

Locked Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If during a deployment you have locked settings, you will see the following warning.

.. figure:: images/adimn_system_configuration_deploy_error.png
    :alt: System Configuration Deployment warning Â  
    
    System Configuration Deployment warning

Using the menu *Settings I'm currently editing*, you can view any settings locked to your user. These are settings which you opened for editing and did not save.

.. note:: 

    A deployment is not possible until all locked settings are resolved. Settings, being edited by another user, will not prevent a deployment.

**Settings locked to other admins:**

Settings may be locked by another administrator. In this case, you will see this. It's not possible to edit this setting at the same time. A user with access to the shell can unlock this using the :ref:`pagenavigation console_index` (Admin::Config::UnlockAll).

Favorite Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Settings marked favorite in the :ref:`pagenavigation admin_systemconfiguration_menu_options` can be accessed with a simple click on the *My favorite settings* button.

Import and Export Settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible to import and export your modified settings. Importing a settings file, will redirect you to the :ref:`pagenavigation admin_systemconfigruation_deploy` screen where you can choose which settings to deploy.

.. warning:: 

    All settings will be saved to the database as modified. Take care which settings are in the file, before you import. The export file is in YAML format, and can easily be edited, to remove unwanted settings before upload.

Sidebar Navigation
==================

Next to :ref:`pagenavigation admin_systemconfiguration_search`, it's possible to navigate through the system configuration options. If add-ons are installed, you can use the dropdown navigation to select which settings you want to navigate through.

- A specific add-on
- Znuny (Framework Settings)
- All settings

Selecting a group of options from the navigation tree will put you in :ref:`pagenavigation admin_systemconfiguration_group_settings_mode`. 

Additional Actions
===================

When in the :ref:`pagenavigation admin_systemconfiguration_group_settings_mode`, you can still see the navigation menu, in others this is not possible.
