Example web services
###############################

It is our goal to help you to get the most out of Znunyl That's why we added some example configurations for web services.

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   mattermost/index
   msteams/index

All examples using REST as HTTP transport and work without any additional add-ons.

.. tip::  Let us know which web service might be interesting for you. Or, much better, add your example configuration with a `pull request <https://github.com/znuny/Znuny/pulls>`_ for all users.
