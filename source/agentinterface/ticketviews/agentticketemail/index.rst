E-Mail New Ticket

.. _PageNavigation ticketviews_agentticketemail:

Create a new ticket when contacting a customer user. This may be used independently of phone contact, or as a way to send the caller a copy of the record. This action starts a communication chain with a customer via e-mail. Do this by selecting *New phone ticket* under *Ticket* in the main menu navigation, or if configured using the toolbar icon :fa:`envelope`.
