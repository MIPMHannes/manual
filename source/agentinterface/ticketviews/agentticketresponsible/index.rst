.. _PageNavigation ticketviews_agentticketresponsible:

The responsible feature must be activated, and then you can use the :ref:`ticket menu <PageNavigation ticketviews_agentticketzoom_ticketmenu>` choosing People -> Responsible to take responsibility for the ticket. The responsible agent has full-permissions on the ticket in any queue, just as the owner does.

It is a second ticket owner.
