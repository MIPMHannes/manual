Managing Entities
#################

An entity is any reusable item within the system. It has, in most cases, a canonical name, a valid setting, and a comment. Typical entities are (but not limited to):

States
Roles
Groups
Attachments
Templates

There are two types of screens when dealing with entities.

The first screen is the entity edit screen which allows you to create or modify an entity and its properties.

The second screen is an entity relationship management screen allowing you to manage the relationship between two entities. Entities may have a one to end relationship or an end to end relationship or an end to one relationship.

For example, if you create a user group and a user role then you can use the groups roles management screen to set the relationship from groups to roles or roles to groups.

Since this concept is standard throughout the system we will not create screenshots for each entity and their management, unless necessary, in each administrator section. We will assume that this concept is basic enough to understand when using the software.
