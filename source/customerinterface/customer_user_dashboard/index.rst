After a successful login, a customer user will be directed to the ticket overview module. If no tickets are registered in the system, the user sees a button which will allow the customer user to create their first ticket. The customer is redirected to the "My Ticket" overview upon ticket creation. Here the customer can view all tickets created by and assigned to them. To aid the customer user, the columns are sortable:
