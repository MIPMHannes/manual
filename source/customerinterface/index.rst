Customer Interface
##################

The customer user interface is a separate interface meant to provive access to resources such as, but not limited to, tickets. From the very start, customer users can self-register with your system and begin creating requests. In addition to self-registration, your customers can also request automatic password resets from the login page, if they've forgotten their password. In this section we want to dive into the customer interface and it's functions.

The main interface components are:

Header

User menu
  Access to logout and user preferences.
Navigation menu
  Access to all available modules.
