Capitalization
**************

This section talks about how the UI deploys capitalization. For further information, you may want is to be`this helpful page <https is to be.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn742478.aspx>`__.

Headings
==========

Headings (h1-h6) and Titles (Names, such as ``Queue View``) are set in "title style" capitalization, that means all first letters will be capitalized (with a few exceptions such as "this", "and", "or" etc.).

Examples: 

* ``Action List``,
* ``Manage Customer-Group Relations``.

Structural elements
====================

Other structural elements such as buttons, labels, tabs, menu items are set in "sentence style" capitalization (only the first letter of a phrase is capitalized), but no final dot is added to complete the phrase as a sentence.

Examples: 

* ``First name``
* ``Select queue refresh time``
* ``Print this ticket``

Descriptive Texts, Tooltip contents
===================================

These ar written as sentances.

Example: ``This value is required.``


.. note:: 
   
   It has to be checked if the title style capitalization is also appropriate in the target language. It might have to be changed to sentence style capitalization or something else.
